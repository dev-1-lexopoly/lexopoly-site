# Launch Channel Strategy - Stealth Founder Edition
**Date**: 2025-10-25
**Products**: QuoteCreator, ComplianceLogger (FamilyCalc, LocalTranscribe pending)
**Status**: 0 sales, need customer acquisition channels
**Privacy Requirement**: Stealth founder - no personal identity exposure

---

## Executive Summary

**Challenge**: Product Hunt and similar platforms typically require founder names/profiles.

**Solution**: Prioritize fully anonymous channels (Hacker News, Reddit, Indie Hackers) where pseudonyms/company names are standard. Use Product Hunt only with pseudonym ("Lex @ Lexopoly") if other channels prove successful.

**Reddit Status**: ⚠️ u/Lexopoly PERMANENTLY BANNED (2025-10-12, FreeKarma violations, appeal filed 13 days ago with no response). New account strategy required.

**Recommended First Move**: Hacker News "Show HN" post this week (fully anonymous, high ROI).

---

## Tier 1: Fully Anonymous Channels (No Identity Required)

### 1. Hacker News "Show HN" ⭐ RECOMMENDED FIRST

**Why This First**:
- ✅ Throwaway accounts fully accepted
- ✅ Username like "lexopoly_dev" or random string (e.g., "throwaway_2025")
- ✅ No profile photo, bio, or personal info required
- ✅ Tech-savvy audience (developers, founders, engineers)
- ✅ High-quality traffic - HN readers are decision-makers
- ✅ Zero personal identity risk

**Audience**:
- Developers, startup founders, tech professionals
- 500,000+ daily readers
- High engagement (front page = 10,000-50,000 views)

**CAC Estimate**: $10-40 per customer (organic, free)

**Success Metrics**:
- Front page = top 30 stories (lasts 6-12 hours)
- Expect 200-500 signups if reach front page
- Best day: Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10am PT

**Format**:
```
Title: Show HN: QuoteCreator - Professional estimates in 60 seconds
Body:
I built QuoteCreator to solve the frustration of creating estimates on-site.
Contractors, consultants, and service professionals can generate polished quotes
in under a minute - no complex software, just fast results.

Try it: [link]
Demo: [link]

Happy to answer questions!
```

**HN Etiquette**:
- ✅ Be humble, ask for feedback
- ✅ Respond to every comment (engage genuinely)
- ✅ Don't delete negative feedback (address it instead)
- ✅ Mention if it's a free trial, pricing model, etc.
- ❌ Don't over-hype ("revolutionary", "game-changing")
- ❌ Don't argue with critics (thank them for feedback)

**Timeline**: Can post TODAY (no account aging required)

### 🚨 HN LAUNCH ATTEMPT #1 - OCTOBER 25, 2025 (FAILED)

**Account**: Lexopoly_Dev (created 2025-10-25)
**Post**: QuoteCreator - Professional estimates in 60 seconds
**Post ID**: 45705545
**Post URL**: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45705545
**Result**: [DEAD] - Shadowbanned within 44 minutes

**What Happened**:
- New account (1 karma) posted commercial content
- HN spam filter auto-killed post
- Post visible only to author when logged in
- Completely invisible to all other HN users

**The Discrepancy**:
- Desktop Chrome (logged in): Post showed at #28 in /newest ✅
- Mobile devices (logged out): Post completely invisible ❌
- Classic shadowban behavior: Author sees post, no one else can

**Root Cause**:
HN guidelines state: "It's ok to post your own stuff **part of the time**"
- Lexopoly_Dev: Brand new account, first post was commercial Show HN
- Violation: 100% self-promotion with zero community participation
- Auto-spam filter correctly identified pattern: new account + commercial = spam risk

**Was the link "crap"?** No. QuoteCreator is legitimate product with technical depth.
**Problem**: Account behavior, not link quality.

**Lesson Learned**: Cannot post commercial Show HN on brand-new accounts
- Need 50-100+ karma before commercial posts
- Must build credibility through comments/engagement first
- HN is a community first, launch platform second

**Recovery Plan**:
1. ✅ Email hn@ycombinator.com requesting vouching (low success rate ~20%)
2. ✅ Build karma naturally over 2-3 weeks (recommended)
3. ✅ Repost mid-November after establishing account credibility

**Email Sent**: ✅ October 25, 2025 at 2:31 PM
**Mod Response**: ✅ October 25, 2025 at 2:33 PM (2-minute response!)
**Username Change Requested**: ✅ October 25, 2025 at 2:55 PM
**Status**: **AWAITING USERNAME CHANGE & VOUCHING**
**New Username**: Lex_O.P._Lee (mod will change + vouch)
**Expected Post Revival**: Within 1-4 hours (or Monday if mod offline)

**Documentation**:
- Full autopsy: `/docs/launch-evidence/QuoteCreator_HN_Post_KILLED_20251025.md`
- ComplianceLogger draft saved for future launch
- Recovery playbook: `/docs/HN_RECOVERY_STRATEGY.md`

**Status**: Waiting on karma-building strategy before next HN attempt

---

### 2. Reddit (New Account Required)

**Status**: 🚨 **u/Lexopoly PERMANENTLY BANNED** (2025-10-12)

**Ban Details**:
- Reason: Posted in FreeKarma subreddits (honeypot for spam bots)
- Activity: ~10 comments pitching QuoteCreator immediately after account creation
- Zero authentic engagement
- Textbook spam bot behavior
- Appeal filed 2025-10-12, **no response in 13 days** (unban unlikely)

**Recovery Strategy - NEW Account**:

**Account Setup** (Week 1):
1. Create NEW account: u/LexopolyDev or u/QuoteCreator_Dev
2. **Age account for 1-2 weeks BEFORE posting products**
3. Build 50-100 karma from genuine comments (not FreeKarma subs!)
4. Participate authentically in target communities

**Karma Building (Weeks 1-2)**:
- ✅ Comment in r/entrepreneur (business advice, not pitches)
- ✅ Comment in r/smallbusiness (genuine help, not product mentions)
- ✅ Share insights in r/Contractors, r/LegalAdvice (expertise, not sales)
- ✅ Upvote, engage, be helpful
- ❌ NEVER mention FreeKarma or use karma-farming subs
- ❌ NEVER pitch product in comments (wait 2-4 weeks)

**Launch Subreddits** (Week 3-4):
- r/SideProject (show your work, ask for feedback)
- r/entrepreneur (business discussion)
- r/smallbusiness (target customers for QuoteCreator)
- r/Contractors (QuoteCreator specifically)
- r/LegalAdvice + r/Lawyers (ComplianceLogger EPA compliance)

**90/10 Rule**:
- 90% value-add (helpful comments, genuine engagement)
- 10% self-promotion (link to products only when relevant)

**CAC Estimate**: $10-30 per customer

**Timeline**: Week 3-4 (after account aging + karma building)

---

### 3. Indie Hackers

**Identity Required**: Company name only (no personal name)

**Account Setup**:
- Username: "Lexopoly" or "LexopolyTeam"
- No personal photo (use company logo)
- Bio: "Building privacy-first professional tools. Products: QuoteCreator, ComplianceLogger."

**Post Format**:
```
Title: Launched 2 products, 0 sales - what am I missing?

Body:
I've launched QuoteCreator (professional estimates for contractors) and
ComplianceLogger (EPA compliance for manufacturers). Both are live, but
I haven't gotten a single sale yet.

Products:
- QuoteCreator: quotecreator.lexopoly.com
- ComplianceLogger: lexopoly.com/compliancelogger

What I've tried:
- SEO blog content
- Professional landing pages
- Free demos

What am I missing? How do you get your first 10 customers?

Open to all feedback!
```

**Why This Works on IH**:
- ✅ Indie maker community is supportive, not judgmental
- ✅ "Building in public" culture (sharing struggles is encouraged)
- ✅ Many founders share revenue numbers, honest feedback
- ✅ No personal identity required
- ✅ Can ask "dumb questions" without reputation risk

**CAC Estimate**: $5-20 per customer

**Timeline**: Can post IMMEDIATELY (no account aging required)

---

## Tier 2: Pseudonym-Friendly Channels

### 4. Product Hunt (Pseudonym Accepted)

**Identity Strategy**: "Lex @ Lexopoly" or "Lexopoly Team"

**Account Setup**:
1. Create account with pen name: "Lex" or "Lex Dev"
2. Use company logo as avatar (not personal photo)
3. Bio: "Solo founder building professional software for lawyers, contractors, and compliance teams. Privacy advocate, stealth mode."
4. Build 10-20 karma by commenting on other launches (1-2 weeks)

**Profile Example**:
```
Name: Lex (Lexopoly)
Bio: Building privacy-first professional tools. Stealth founder.
Twitter: @lexopoly (company account)
Website: lexopoly.com
```

**Launch Strategy**:
- Post on Tuesday-Thursday (highest traffic)
- 12:01am PT (to maximize 24-hour voting window)
- Tagline: "Professional estimates in 60 seconds"
- First comment: Explain story, ask for feedback

**Why Pseudonym Works**:
- ✅ Product Hunt accepts pen names/company names
- ✅ No legal name verification
- ✅ Many founders use pseudonyms (e.g., "levels.io", "indie hacker")
- ✅ Company logo instead of personal photo
- ⚠️ Need some profile activity (not brand new throwaway)

**CAC Estimate**: $10-40 per customer

**Timeline**: Week 4 (after success on HN/Reddit/IH validates approach)

---

## Launch Templates

### Template 1: Hacker News "Show HN" (QuoteCreator)

```
Title: Show HN: QuoteCreator - Professional estimates in 60 seconds

Body:
I built QuoteCreator after watching contractors struggle with estimate software.
Most tools are bloated CRMs with month-long learning curves. QuoteCreator does
one thing: create polished quotes in under a minute.

Target users:
- Contractors (plumbing, electrical, HVAC)
- Consultants (hourly rates + project scopes)
- Freelancers (designers, developers, writers)

Try it: https://quotecreator.lexopoly.com
Demo: https://lexopoly.com/demo

Tech stack: Next.js, IndexedDB (local storage, no server), hosted on DigitalOcean.

Pricing: Free demo, $12.99 one-time purchase (no subscription).

Happy to answer questions about building it, the market, or anything else!
```

---

### Template 2: Hacker News "Show HN" (ComplianceLogger)

```
Title: Show HN: ComplianceLogger - Reconstruct EPA compliance records after a fire

Body:
I built ComplianceLogger for small manufacturers facing EPA audits without records.
If you lose maintenance logs in a fire, flood, or ransomware attack, you're facing
$37,500 fines per day per violation.

ComplianceLogger helps you reconstruct:
- Hazmat equipment maintenance logs
- Waste disposal records
- Training certifications
- Inspection histories

Using a 3-tier confidence system (photos → receipts → memory), it creates
audit-defensible documentation even with incomplete information.

Try it: https://lexopoly.com/compliancelogger
Case study: https://lexopoly.com/blog/epa-audit-notice-30-days/

Tech stack: Next.js, PostgreSQL, Vercel.

Pricing: $149/year (much cheaper than EPA fines).

Built this after seeing too many small manufacturers shut down over paperwork violations.

Questions welcome!
```

### Template 3: Reddit r/SideProject (QuoteCreator)

```
Title: [Launch] QuoteCreator - Create professional estimates in 60 seconds

Body:
Hey r/SideProject,

I've been working on QuoteCreator for the past few months and finally launched last week.
It's a tool for contractors, consultants, and freelancers to create professional estimates
on-site without complex CRM software.

**The Problem**:
Most estimate software is bloated (QuickBooks, Salesforce) or requires WiFi/cellular.
Contractors need something fast that works offline.

**My Solution**:
QuoteCreator runs in the browser, stores everything locally (IndexedDB), and
generates PDF estimates in under a minute. No account, no WiFi, no bloat.

**Tech Stack**:
- Next.js 14 (React)
- IndexedDB (local storage)
- TailwindCSS
- PDF generation client-side

**Current Status**:
- Live: https://quotecreator.lexopoly.com
- Demo: https://lexopoly.com/demo
- Pricing: Free demo, $12.99 one-time

**Feedback Needed**:
1. Is the pricing too low? ($12.99 one-time vs $30/month)
2. Should I add invoicing features or keep it simple?
3. Any UX issues with the demo?

Thanks for checking it out! Open to all feedback.
```

### Template 4: Indie Hackers (Honest Ask)

```
Title: Launched 2 products, 0 sales - what am I missing?

Body:
I've launched QuoteCreator (professional estimates for contractors) and
ComplianceLogger (EPA compliance for manufacturers). Both products are live,
professionally designed landing pages, SEO blog content... but I haven't
gotten a single sale yet.

**Products**:
- QuoteCreator: https://quotecreator.lexopoly.com ($12.99 one-time)
- ComplianceLogger: https://lexopoly.com/compliancelogger ($149/year)

**What I've tried**:
- ✅ SEO blog articles (8+ published, indexed by Google)
- ✅ Professional landing pages (hired designer for mockups)
- ✅ Free demos (users can try before buying)
- ✅ X/Twitter account (@lexopoly)
- ❌ Reddit (account banned for FreeKarma violations - learned the hard way)
- ❌ Product Hunt (not launched yet)

**What I'm missing** (I think):
- Customer acquisition channels (no traffic, no sales)
- Social proof (0 testimonials, 0 case studies)
- Maybe pricing is wrong? ($12.99 too cheap? $149 too expensive?)
- Maybe products solve problems nobody has?

**Questions**:
1. How do you get your first 10 customers?
2. Is Hacker News "Show HN" a good starting point?
3. Should I give away free licenses to get testimonials?
4. Am I solving problems that don't exist?

Open to all feedback - even brutal honesty. I'm stuck and need direction.

Thanks!
```

## Success Metrics by Channel

| Channel | CAC | Expected Signups | Conversion Rate | Customers | Revenue |
|---------|-----|------------------|-----------------|-----------|---------|
| **Hacker News** (front page) | $10-40 | 200-500 | 5-10% | 10-50 | $130-650 |
| **Reddit** (r/SideProject) | $10-30 | 100-300 | 3-8% | 3-24 | $40-310 |
| **Indie Hackers** | $5-20 | 50-100 | 10-15% | 5-15 | $65-195 |
| **Product Hunt** (top 5) | $10-40 | 500-2,000 | 5-10% | 25-200 | $325-2,600 |
| **TOTAL (4 weeks)** | - | 850-2,900 | - | 43-289 | $560-3,755 |

**Assumptions**:
- QuoteCreator pricing: $12.99 one-time
- Conversion rate: 5-10% (demo → purchase)
- All channels executed successfully

**Reality Check**: Even 43 customers would validate product-market fit and prove acquisition channels work.

---

## Alternative Channels (Lower Priority)

### 5. BetaList / LaunchingNext

**Why Lower Priority**: Less traffic than HN/PH, but zero identity required

**Setup**:
- Submit as company name
- No founder spotlight
- Product-focused directories

**CAC**: $20-50

---

### 6. Twitter/X (@lexopoly)

**Already Active**: Company account exists

**Strategy**:
- Tweet daily: building in public, product updates, industry insights
- No personal identity (company brand only)
- Engage with target customers (contractors, lawyers, manufacturers)

**CAC**: $30-80 (organic, slow build)

---

### 7. Direct Outreach (Email/LinkedIn)

**Privacy-Friendly**:
- Email signature: "Lex from Lexopoly"
- LinkedIn company page (no personal profile required)
- Cold emails to target verticals

**CAC**: $50-150 (time-intensive)

---

## Reddit Ban Detailed Analysis

### What Happened

**Account**: u/Lexopoly
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Banned**: 2025-10-12 (same day)
**Appeal**: Filed 2025-10-12, **no response in 13 days** (as of 2025-10-25)

**Activity Before Ban**:
1. Posted "hello world" in FreeKarma subreddits (CRITICAL VIOLATION)
2. ~10 comments pitching QuoteCreator to users with invoicing problems
3. All activity within hours of account creation
4. Zero authentic engagement (no non-commercial comments)

### Why This Was Wrong

**FreeKarma Subreddits Are Honeypots**:
- Reddit site-wide rule: FreeKarma subs are explicitly banned
- Posting there = automatic spam flag
- Permanent ban (rarely reversed)
- Even mentioning FreeKarma gets you flagged

**Commercial Hunting = Spam**:
- New account seeking problems to pitch product
- No value-add comments (only self-promotion)
- Violated "90/10 rule" (should be 90% helpful, 10% promotional)

**Textbook Spam Bot Behavior**:
- Account created for sole purpose of selling
- Immediate product pitches
- Zero authentic community participation
- Identical pattern to MLM bots and dropshippers

### How to Do It Right (New Account)

**Phase 1: Account Setup (Day 1)**
- Create account with non-spammy username (u/LexopolyDev or u/QuoteCreatorDev)
- Fill out basic profile (optional bio, no product links yet)
- Subscribe to target subreddits

**Phase 2: Karma Building (Weeks 1-2)**
- 10-15 helpful comments per week in r/entrepreneur
- 10-15 helpful comments per week in r/smallbusiness
- 5-10 helpful comments per week in vertical subs (r/Contractors, r/LegalAdvice)
- NO product mentions (just genuine expertise sharing)

**Goal**: 50-100 karma, account age 14+ days

**Phase 3: First Product Mention (Week 3)**
- Post in r/SideProject (show-and-tell culture, self-promotion OK)
- Format: "Built QuoteCreator for contractors - feedback welcome"
- Focus on feedback request, not sales pitch

**Phase 4: Gradual Expansion (Weeks 4+)**
- 90/10 rule: 90% helpful comments, 10% product mentions
- Only mention product when directly relevant (someone asks "how do I create estimates?")
- Build reputation before pitching

### Appeal Prognosis

**Realistic Outlook**: Unban is **highly unlikely**

**Why**:
- FreeKarma violations are rarely reversed
- 13 days with no response = low priority case
- Reddit rarely overturns spam bans
- Pattern was objectively spammy (not borderline)

**Best Path Forward**: Create new account, follow proper karma building strategy

---

## Privacy-Preserving Launch Approach Summary

### Best Stealth Strategy (Recommended)

**Week 1**: Hacker News "Show HN"
- Fully anonymous (throwaway account)
- Zero personal identity exposure
- Test product-market fit
- Get honest feedback

**Week 2**: Reddit account aging
- Build karma authentically
- No product mentions yet

**Week 3**: Indie Hackers + Reddit r/SideProject
- Company name only (no personal identity)
- Share honest story
- Ask for help, not sales

**Week 4**: Product Hunt (if needed)
- Pseudonym "Lex @ Lexopoly"
- Company logo, not personal photo
- Only if Weeks 1-3 showed traction

**Result**: 43-289 customers without revealing personal identity

---

## Next Steps (Immediate Actions)

**This Week**:
1. ✅ Create throwaway HN account ("lexopoly_dev")
2. ✅ Draft "Show HN: QuoteCreator" post using template above
3. ✅ Post Tuesday 9am PT for maximum visibility
4. ✅ Respond to every comment (engage genuinely)

**Week 2**:
1. Create new Reddit account (u/LexopolyDev)
2. Build karma through helpful comments (no product mentions)
3. If HN went well, post "Show HN: ComplianceLogger"

**Week 3**:
1. Post on Indie Hackers (honest ask for help)
2. First Reddit post in r/SideProject (after karma built)

**Week 4**:
1. Evaluate results from Weeks 1-3
2. If traction exists, launch on Product Hunt with pseudonym
3. If no traction, pivot strategy (pricing? messaging? product-market fit?)

**Success Criteria** (4 weeks):
- 50+ signups (any channel)
- 5+ paying customers
- Positive feedback (NPS >40)
- Validation that acquisition channels work

**Pivot Criteria** (4 weeks):
- <50 signups total (no channel worked)
- 0 paying customers (product-market fit issue?)
- Negative feedback (product doesn't solve real problem?)

---

## Final Recommendation

**Start with Hacker News this week**:
- Fully anonymous (zero identity risk)
- High-quality audience (tech-savvy decision-makers)
- Honest feedback (HN users are blunt but fair)
- If it flops, no reputation damage (throwaway account)
- If it succeeds, repeat for ComplianceLogger next week

**Delay Product Hunt until you have 100+ users** from anonymous channels. By then, you'll have social proof, testimonials, and validation that the products work. Product Hunt becomes amplification, not validation.

**Reddit Strategy**: Create new account TODAY, age it while doing HN/IH launches, post in Week 3 after karma built.

---

**Document Status**: Ready for execution
**Next Action**: Draft HN "Show HN" post, schedule for Tuesday 9am PT
**Date**: 2025-10-25
