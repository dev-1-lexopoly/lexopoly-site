## Polish Sprint Tasks (from CC-FCO Memo)

### P0 - Homepage Product Hierarchy
**Problem:** Homepage shows 5 products with equal weight across different markets (legal tools, construction compliance, transcription). Feels scattered.

**Fix:**
- Lead with law firm tools: RevenueRescue → CASS Calculator → QuoteCreator
- Move LocalTranscribe and ComplianceLogger lower (they serve different markets)
- Consider grouping: "For Law Firms" section vs "Other Industries"

**Files:** `index.html`

---

### P1 - LocalTranscribe Pricing Inconsistency
**Problem:** Main page shows $79, FAQ mentions "$39-79/user monthly" - contradictory.

**Current state (from grep):**
- Meta description: "$39-79/user monthly"
- Hero/CTA: "$79 one-time purchase"
- FAQ: "$39-79/user monthly plan"

**Fix:** Align pricing across page. Pick one number or explain tiers clearly.

**Files:** `localtranscribe/index.html`

---

### P1 - Accuracy Claims (LocalTranscribe)
**Problem:** Page claims both "85-92%" and "95-98% for clear audio" - confusing.

**Current state (from grep):**
- Most places: "85-92% accuracy"
- FAQ answer: "typically 95-98% for clear audio"

**Fix:** Pick one defensible claim or clarify the distinction.

**Files:** `localtranscribe/index.html`

---

### P2 - /lawyers Page Focus
**Problem:** The "For Lawyers" vertical page emphasizes LocalTranscribe heavily, but RevenueRescue is the flagship product for law firms.

**Current state:** Page leads with LocalTranscribe, has "LocalTranscribe Features for Lawyers" section.

**Fix:** Reorder to lead with RevenueRescue on the lawyers page.

**Files:** `lawyers/index.html`

---

### P2 - Social Proof
**Problem:** No testimonials or customer quotes on any product page.

**Fix:** Add testimonials if available. Even 1-2 quotes per product helps. If none available, skip for now.

**Status:** Likely skip - no testimonials available yet.

---

### P3 - Demo Videos
**Opportunity:** Product demo videos exist but aren't embedded on product pages.

- RevenueRescue demo: https://youtu.be/71UviCSALlk
- QuoteCreator demo: https://youtu.be/HduhBgkKW50

**Fix:** Embed or link videos on respective product pages.

**Files:** `revenuerescue/index.html`, `quotecreator/index.html`

---

## Out of Scope (per CC-FCO)
- No Clio badges or "security approved" messaging (premature)
- No major redesign (current design is good)
- No new pages needed
- No investor-specific content

---

## Estimated Effort
2-4 hours for full polish sprint
