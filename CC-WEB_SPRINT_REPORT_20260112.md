### Task 4: LocalTranscribe Pricing Fix (P1)
**Files:** `localtranscribe/index.html`, `lawyers/index.html`, `pricing/index.html`

Removed all "$39-79/user monthly" references, standardized on "$79 one-time":

---

### Task 6: Demo Video Embeds (P1) — PENDING
**Status:** Reverted, awaiting customer-facing demo videos

- RevenueRescue: https://youtu.be/71UviCSALlk (internal)
- QuoteCreator: https://youtu.be/HduhBgkKW50 (internal)

**Action required:** Shoot customer-facing demo videos, then re-implement Task 6.
