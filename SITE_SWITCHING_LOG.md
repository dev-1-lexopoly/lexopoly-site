**Action**: SITE_OFF (Full Site → Under Construction)
**Timestamp**: 2025-10-14T01:36:26Z
**Operator**: Claude Code (user: rain)
**Git State Before Switch**:
- Commit: `b8f4a75` (feat: Add immutable ledger requirement)
- Branch: `main`
- Status: Clean working tree

**Reason** (required, short): Visual testing of construction page

**Backup Created**:
- Git Tag: `site-full-backup-20251014-013626`
- Backup File: `index.full-backup.html` (will be created, ~53KB)
- Tag Message: "Full site backup before construction mode - 2025-10-14T01:36:26Z"

**State Transition**:
- Previous: `index.html` = Full site (products, navigation, 6 verticals, blog)
- New: `index.html` = Under construction (minimal page, 2 contact methods)

**Files Modified**:
- `index.html` (replaced with construction template)
- `index.full-backup.html` (created from previous index.html)
